## Air hockey machine - One of my most notable projects
* I'm excited to speak with you about my experience and skills in the field of embedded systems, robotics, and automation. One of my most notable projects is the “air hockey machine”, which I worked on from 2018 to 2019.
* In this project, I implemented Simulink to control robotic arms, enabling the machine to play air hockey with a human opponent. I also wrote a program using C++ and OpenCV to perform image processing tasks, allowing the machine to see the hockey puck and accurately forecast its location and speed.
* Additionally, I used MATLAB to construct the virtual XY coordinate of the table and implemented ROS to connect different programming environments. This project challenged me to use a variety of programming languages and tools, and I'm proud of the end result.
